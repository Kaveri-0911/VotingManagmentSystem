# Voting System

A simple console-based voting system implemented in Java.

## Project Overview

This project was created to demonstrate a basic voting system implementation in Java. It showcases object-oriented programming concepts, input validation, and a simple user interface. The goal was to create a functional voting system that could handle voter registration, secure login, vote casting, and result display.

## Features

- **Voter Registration**: Allows users to register as voters by entering age, name, voter ID, and password .
- **Secure Login System**: Implements a login mechanism using voter ID and password .
- **Vote Casting**: Enables users to cast votes for registered candidates .
- **Candidate List Display**: Shows a list of registered candidates with their numbers and names .
- **Result Display**: Displays the final election results, including vote counts for each candidate .
- **Winner Determination**: Identifies the winning candidate(s) based on the highest number of votes .
- **User Interface**: Provides a menu-driven interface for users to navigate between different functions .
- **Input Validation**: Includes error handling for invalid inputs (e.g., incorrect age or invalid voter ID).
- **Data Storage**: Uses Vectors to store voter information and candidate data .
- **Code Organization**: Separates functionality into different classes (Voter, Candidate, VotingProcess) .
- **Security**: Implements password protection for voter accounts .
- **Scalability**: Uses arrays and Vectors to handle multiple voters and candidates .

## What I Learned

1. The importance of clear project description: A concise yet informative description helps users quickly understand the project's purpose and value.

2. Markdown formatting: Using proper markdown syntax enhances readability and makes the README more visually appealing.

3. Structured content: Organizing sections logically (Project Overview, Features, How to Run, etc.) improves navigation and comprehension.

4. Key information placement: Placing essential details like installation instructions early in the README ensures users can start using the software quickly.

5. Consistency: Maintaining a consistent style throughout the document improves professionalism and readability.

6. Error handling: Incorporating error messages and validation checks demonstrates attention to user experience.

7. Modular design: Separating functionality into distinct classes showcases good software engineering practices.

8. User interaction: Creating an intuitive menu-driven interface enhances usability.

9. Data management: Efficient use of data structures like Vectors shows consideration for scalability and performance.

10. Security considerations: Implementing password protection adds a layer of security to the system.
